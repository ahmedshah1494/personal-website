		<h4>Abstract</h4>
				<p>Wireless networks share a common channel that is spatially reused. This gives rise to interesting and complex interference phenomena that have substantial effects on performance and fairness.  The shared channel makes wireless networks a strongly coupled system where decisions by one node can have a substantial and cascading effect on other nodes in the system.  Developing effective distributed protocols in such an environment is challenging since local decisions can have significant effect making it difficult to converge to effective operating points.<br>
				SDN is establishing itself as a game changing technology in managing network infrastructure in a number of networking domains. SDNs makes it possible to carry out decisions that are globally effective and introduce the level of coordination not possible with distributed protocols. In addition, an SDN framework offers advantages with respect to service deployment, network monitoring and instrumentation as well as security.<br>
				In this research project, we review some of the recent developments in wireless mobility, investigate the possibility of predicting paths to pre-empt access point handoff and investigate the feasibility of using Raspberry PIs, a lowcost credit card-sized single-board computer, as an SDN enabled wireless routers for a Wireless Mesh Network.
