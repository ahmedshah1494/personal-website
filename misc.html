				<h4>Abstract</h4>
				<p>The development of social media, complemented with the popularity of footage capturing devices, has made surveillance accessible to the masses. This paper argues that social media institutes, to a certain degree, an atmosphere of accountability and responsibility by instilling in the people the realization that every action that they do in public can be recorded and the footage proliferated over social media. Survey conducted over a diverse sample of 100 social media users evidences that the feeling of being under surveillance is very real due to which people tend to modify their real life behavior to avoid getting into tedious predicaments. I examine how this phenomenon affects individual users using examples of incidents in which people have been held accountable for actions that they performed without the realization that they are being recorded. Extending this argument to institutions I examine how formal establishments such as corporations, law enforcement agencies and even governments, previously considered immune to surveillance, are forced to be mindful of their actions.</p>

				<h4>Abstract</h4>
				<p>This literature review examines the relationship between media exposure andeating disorders by presenting and critiquing 6 articles published between 1994 and 2014. It presents early research that examines how psychological byproducts of exposure to popular media, such as internalization of thin-body ideals, are predictive of disordered eating behavior. Then it examines later research into the specific types and genres of media that are most strongly related to disordered eating and their variance across genders. Finally it touches upon the impact of the modern social media paradigm promotes body dissatisfaction and other psychological traits that have been directly or indirectly linked to the development of eating disorders.</p>

				<h4>Abstract</h4>
				<p>Information Extraction systems are a major area of research in the field of Natural Language Processing. IE systems, as the name suggests, are designed to find and understand relevant parts of texts and/or gather information from pieces of texts.<br>Named Entity Recognition (NER), the focus of this report, is a subtask in the field of Information Extraction. NER systems are designed to examine pieces of text and using pre-determined features,classify the constituent words. These systems can either be used to provide binary results, i.e. tag words with a true or false tag representing whether they are named entities or not, or assign more informative tags to words that differentiate between named entities, i.e. persons, locations or organizations.<br>This report examines some of the previous work in the field of NER by providing an overview ofcurrent state-of-the art systems , and then analyses the effectivness of a NE tagger based on a NaiveBayes sequence classifier.</p>
